# python-api-Module 6 Challenge
Instructions
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

# Dependencies and Setup
# Import API key
# Load the CSV file created in Part 1 into a Pandas DataFrame
### Step 1: Create a map that displays a point for every city in the `city_data_df` DataFrame. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
### Step 2: Narrow down the `city_data_df` DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition
### Step 3: Create a new DataFrame called `hotel_df`.
### Step 4: For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates.
## Step 5: Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.

## Starter Code to Generate Random Geographic Coordinates and a List of Cities
# Dependencies and Setup
# Impor the OpenWeatherMap API key
# Import citipy to determine the cities based on latitude and longitude
### Generate the Cities List by Using the `citipy` Library
## Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude

### Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code
### Create the Scatter Plots Requested

#### Latitude Vs. Temperature
## Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
